This game was a challenge for me in C using the N-curses library, and it's played entirely within the shell with ASCII graphics.

Inspired by the [1978 arcade game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) (long before my time) 

To use this repo:

```
cd Desktop (or other desired directory)
git clone https://github.com/Krish-sysadmin/spaceInvaders
cd spaceInvaders
gcc -o spacegame invaders.c -lncurses && ./spacegame (compiles and executes the executable)
```
